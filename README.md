# FlaMingle

The project is TikTok's creative assignment, creating novel filters.

FlaMingle aims to bring a fun and environmental message of 'Donâ€™t get a part, be part of it. The filter brings TikTok users to the world of flamingos and lets them participate in good changes, by mingling with flamingos. 
It is a full-body filter based on a rear camera. 

After researching current filters, I've found that there is a lack of diversity in full-body triggered filters. Most of them were focused on body segmentation or avatar body mapping. I thought about the new way to trigger events and how it can store messages that could be both viral and positive.

The project is based on ARfoundation samples(https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples), using 3D body tracking as the base of the project.
ARFoundation: 4.2.2/ ARCore XR Plugin:4.2.2/ ARKit XR Plugin: 4.2.2/ ARKit Face Tracking: 4.2.2
The current project also used ARfoundation remote(4.9.3) for easier testing, which is not uploaded to GitHub.
